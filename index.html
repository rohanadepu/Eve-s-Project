        <h1>Earth A:</h1>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li><h3>What is different from our current Earth to the new Earth?</h3></li><ul>
            <li>Its moon moves twice as fast around earth A, while earth A travels around its sun twice as fast. </li>
            <li>The earth will be larger as the velocity of the earth increased.</li>
            <li>The moon’s mass will also increase as it will moving twice as fast as well, but not as much as the gravity of the larger earth will be greater pulling the moon in closer, creating a already faster orbit. </li></ul>
            <li><h3>What changes will it cause to Earth?</h3></li><ul>
            <li>The larger earth will cause the earth to have a more controlled ecosystem, climate, and more. </li>
            <li>Also, speaking of the evolution of life, the increased size of the earth will increase the weight of everything on earth, so some materials from our current earth could collapse on the new earth. Humans and other animals would probably adapt to have strudier legs that can carry the weight.</li></ul>
            <li><h3>What will happen to the atmosphere?</h3></li><ul>
            <li>Due to the earth closer distance to the sun, parts of our current atmosphere will dissipate due to the sun intense heat. This process is caused by the sun heating the molecules in the atmosphere so fast that it will reach escape velocity and eventually leave the atmosphere.</li></ul>
            <li><h3>How will this change affect humans?</h3></li><ul>
            <li>Due to the increase of Gravity it will feel like you are carrying yourself while walking, so this change will make humans legs useless. In the future of Earth A, humans will need sturdier legs to walk around.</li></ul>
          </ul>
          <h2></h2>
          <ul>
            <li><h3>Time</h3></li><ul>
            <li>12 hours in a day</li>
            <li>Approximately 183 days in a year</li></ul>
          </ul>
          <h2>Climate</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><h3>Stable or more variable?</h3></li><ul>
            <li>It is a theory that a larger earth would result in a more stable climate. However, the earth is closer to the sun and some of the atmosphere will have dissipated and the greater gravitational pull will cause the atmosphere to be closer to the ground, causing higher pressure which will create more violent storms. Also, with the addition of stronger tides because of the closer Sun and Moon.</li></ul>
            <li><h3>Hurricanes, winds, air pressure, wetter, etc..?</h3></li><ul>
            <li>The atmospheric pressure will be higher overall as the planet is larger and has a strong gravitational pull. There maybe more hurricanes as the tidal forces from the Sun and Moon are much stronger due to the closer distance.</li></ul>
            <li><h3>Planetary temperature</h3></li><ul>
            <li>The overall planetary temperature would increase as the earth is closer to the sun.</li></ul>
          </ul>
          <h2>Seasons</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><h3>Length compared to Earth, or do they even exist?</h3></li><ul>
            <li>The Earth would still have seasons, it would just be a little warmer each season. There are still seasons because the till of the Earth did not disappear for this earth.</li></ul>
          </ul>
          <h2>Geological Activities</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><h3>Geologic activity such as earthquakes or volcanoes</h3></li><ul>
            <li>Since, the Moon and Sun is closer to the Earth it could create more earthquakes because of the stronger gravitational tides that it puts on Earth creating small tremors that could become a earthquake or an volcano eruption.</li></ul>
          </ul>
          <h2>Lunar phase</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><h3>Number of Earth days for the moon to orbit earth (Orbital Period)?</h3></li><ul>
            <li>13.5 Days in the cycle</li></ul>
            <li><h3>Number of orbits in an Earth year?</h3></li><ul>
            <li>13.5555 Orbits in a year</li></ul>
            <li><h3>Would lunar phases appear different to us in any way?</h3></li><ul>
            <li>The lunar phases will appear to be shorter for us as the moon will be rotating around the earth twice as fast than normal.</li></ul>
          </ul>
          <h2>Eclipses:  Solar and Lunar</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><h3>Duration & Frequency in Earth units:</h3></li><ul>
            <li>There will be approximately  2-3 solar eclipses every three years.</li>
            <li>The duration of the total lunar eclipse will last approximately 2 hours, 36 minutes. </li>
            <li>There will be approximately 2-3 lunar eclipses every year.</li></ul>
            <li><h3>Would they appear different?</h3></li><ul>
            <li>Since the moon is closer to the Earth there could be more coverage of the sun as the moon is bigger and the sun is the same size, during solar eclipse.</li></ul>
            <li><h3>Size of the Umbra compared to Earth, Moon, and Sun</h3></li><ul>
            <li>The size of the Umbra will be large considering the size of the Earth is large, but to proportion, it will not be a big difference, as the moon grew too. </li></ul>
          </ul>
          <h2>Major long-term threats to colonists:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><h3>Is there a likelihood, earth or moon escaping the gravity and careening into space?</h3></li><ul>
            <li>No, Earth A can not escape the gravity of the sun, as in this scenario Earth and the Moon have a stronger gravitational pull due to the increase in their size.</li></ul>
            <li><h3>Are components of the sun earth moon system likely to move dangerously closer together?</h3></li><ul>
            <li>There is a possibility that the moon might come too close to the Earth passing the Roche limit, then disintegrating due to the Earth’s tidal forces and the sun’s forces.</li></ul>

        <h2>Necessary Questions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><h3>What is different from our current Earth to the new Earth?</h3></li>
        <ul>
          <li>There would be no seasons, the earth would be much colder, and a year would take twice as long. </li>
        </ul>
        <li><h3>What changes will it cause to Earth?</h3></li>
        <ul>
          <li>Nothing except most life if not all will go extinct.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><h3>What will happen to the atmosphere?</h3></li>
        <ul>
          <li>The atmosphere would be deteriorated less because of more distance between the Sun and Earth.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h2>Major Differences</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><h3>Length of earth Day in Earth hours</h3></li>
          <ul><li>The length of days will all be the same no matter what time of the year depending on your location.</li></ul>
          <li><h3>Length of year (orbital period)</h3></li>
          <ul><li>Takes twice as long since the Earth is twice as far.</li></ul>
          <li><h3>Number of days in a year</h3></li>
          <ul><li>365*2=730 days</li></ul>
          <li><h3>Is there a more stable or more variable climate?</h3></li>
          <ul><li>The climate would be more stable because of the 0-degree tilt causing no seasons.</li>
          <li>The weather would slow or stop climate change which would also cause a more stable climate. </li></ul>
          <li><h3>Type of Weather</h3></li>
          <ul><li>There would be more snow storms but less moisture</li></ul>
          <li><h3>Seasons: Length compared to Earth, or do they even exist?</h3></li>
          <ul><li>Seasons don’t exist because of the 0 degree tilt of the earth which causes more sunlight to shine in different hemispheres based on the time of year.</li></ul>
          <li><h3>How would humans need to adapt in order to thrive on this planet?</h3></li>
          <ul><li>It would be likely that most of life will become extinct because of the extreme temperatures. It could possibly cause the extinction of humans.</li></ul>
          <ul><li>Humans will need to find a way to stay warm, protected and sheltered well. Basic food would become very scarce and humans would have to find a way to self-sustain in extreme temperatures.</li></ul>
          <li><h3>What parts of Earth’s plant or animal kingdom might be affected?</h3></li>
          <ul><li>Most plants and animals that rely on a stable or warm environment would probably die.</li></ul>
          <ul><li>Mostly small organisms that can adapt fast could probably survive.</li></ul>

        <h2>Immediate Threats</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><h3>Asteroid threat</h3></li>
          <ul><li>There is a more likely threat to being hit by asteroids as the asteroid belt ranges from 2.2 to 3.2 AU from the sun.</li></ul>
          <li><h3>Life Extinction</h3></li>
          <ul><li>The temperature on Earth E is calculated to be around -73.95oF using logarithmic regression from the different planets in our solar system.<img src="desmoslogarithmicregressionscienceearthe.PNG"></li></ul>

        <h2>Human Observational Similarities and Differences</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><h3>Number of orbits in an Earth year</h3></li>
          <ul><li>The moon orbits the Earth 13 times in a normal year.</li>
          <li>13*2=26 which is the number of orbits in the Earth E scenario.</li></ul>
          <li><h3>Size of the Umbra compared to Earth, Moon Sun</h3></li>
          <ul><li>Since the Earth would be farther away from the Sun, the umbra would be bigger but the penumbra would be smaller.</li></ul>
          <li><h3>Equinox & Solstices</h3></li>
          <ul><li>There would be no solstices because of no tilt but there would be equinoxes every day.</li></ul>
          <li><h3>Aurora’s - How would they compare to Earth’s?</h3></li>
          <ul><li>There would be slightly less auroras because there would be more distance between the Earth and Sun.</li></ul>
          <ul><li>The longer distance allows for less energy to be absorbed on to the earth causing less auroras.</li></ul>
          <li><h3>Constellations Each Year</h3></li>
          <ul><li>The constellations would be consistent in different areas of the Earth at night.</li></ul>
          <li><h3>Motion the sun made in the sky, over a year (ecliptic)</h3></li>
          <ul><li>Same except a wider ellipse</li></ul>

        <h2>Long-term Threats</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><h3>Is there a likelihood, earth or moon escaping the gravity and careening into space?</h3></li>
          <ul><li>It is still very unlikely for this to happen, however, the Earth is slightly closer to Mars which may become a problem.	</li></ul>
          <li><h3>Are components of the sun earth moon system likely to move dangerously closer together? </h3></li>
          <ul><li>No, and the risk of Earth crashing into the sun is decreased because of the distance between them.</li></ul>
          <li><h3>Would our Earth be part of a celestial collision, sooner than Earth would have been? </h3></li>
          <ul><li>Yes, there is more chance of being hit by the asteroid belt.</li></ul>
          <li><h3>Would distant observers in another galaxy notice anything different when they analyzed the EM waves emanating from our solar system.</h3></li>
          <ul><li>The electromagnetic waves penetrating Earth would not be as effective.</li></ul>

      <p>The black hole would suck up pluto than Uranus, Neptune, Saturn, Jupiter and then probably ruin the orbit of our planets like venus mars mercury and earth then eventually fling us into the sun and we die.</p>
  <h3>What is different from our current Earth to the new Earth?</h3> <p> The difference from our earth and this earth is that this earth i</p>
  <h3>What changes will it cause to Earth?</h3> <p>The new earth with either get sucked up by the planet or get thrown into the sun</p>
  <h3>What will happen to the atmosphere?</h3> <p>The atmosphere is going dissipate from the earth because the black hole would move it closer to the sun and burn up the atmosphere</p>
  <h3>How will this change affect humans?</h3> <p>It would burn up the atmosphere and then the oxygen would go into space and humans will die.
  <ol>
    <li>
      Planet: the temperature would increase dramatically cus it would get closer to the sun.
      We wouldn’t be able to breathe because our atmosphere would dissipate
      Most of the animals and bacteria would die to heat or loss of oxygen.
      The earth would be more variable due to the fact that there is a lot of different scenarios that could happen like
      Everything would be much hotter and less water
    </li>
    <li> There would be a lot   from the  belt and it would  hit earth over and over again </li>
    <li> The moon would probably be destroyed by a bunch of  asteroids</li>
    <li>There is a likelihood, earth or moon escaping the gravity and careening into space
  The moon and sun would move closer together and probably collide into each other.</li>
  No they might not notice the EM waves becuase it’s only one solar system being swalled not like a whole galaxy.
