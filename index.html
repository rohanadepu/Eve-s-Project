            <li><h3>What is different from our current Earth to the new Earth?</h3></li><ul>
            <li>Its moon moves twice as fast around earth A, while earth A travels around its sun twice as fast. </li>
            <li>The earth will be larger as the velocity of the earth increased.</li>
            <li>The moon’s mass will also increase as it will moving twice as fast as well, but not as much as the gravity of the larger earth will be greater pulling the moon in closer, creating a already faster orbit. </li></ul>
            <li>What changes will it cause to Earth?</li><ul>
            <li>The larger earth will cause the earth to have a more controlled ecosystem, climate, and more. </li>
            <li>Also, speaking of the evolution of life, the increased size of the earth will increase the weight of everything on earth, so some materials from our current earth could collapse on the new earth. Humans and other animals would probably adapt to have strudier legs that can carry the weight.</li></ul>
            <li>What will happen to the atmosphere?</li><ul>
            <li>Due to the earth closer distance to the sun, parts of our current atmosphere will dissipate due to the sun intense heat. This process is caused by the sun heating the molecules in the atmosphere so fast that it will reach escape velocity and eventually leave the atmosphere.</li></ul>
          </ul>
          <h3>Major differences we’d experience in our everyday lives. (model, if appropriate)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Length of earth day in earth hours</li><ul>
            <li>12 hours</li></ul>
            <li>Length of year (orbital period)	</li><ul>
              <li>Number of Earth days in an earth year</li></ul><ul><ul>
                <li>365 days and 366 days in a leap year</li></ul></ul>
